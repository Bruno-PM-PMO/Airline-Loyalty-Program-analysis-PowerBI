Overview

This project analyzes an airlineâ€™s loyalty program to uncover key customer insights and performance trends. Using Power BI, I built dashboards that help answer critical business questions, such as:

Which customer segments drive the most revenue?

How does flight activity impact loyalty program engagement?

What patterns can we see in churn risk and retention?

The goal was to turn raw data into clear, actionable insights for decision-making.

Data

The dataset includes:

Customer demographics

Flight history

Loyalty program enrollment and usage
